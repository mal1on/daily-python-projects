    The program starts by showing the user a menu. The user enters a
    number (e.g., 2 to add a new name to the text file) and then
    proceeds with the instructions (e.g., adding a name such as Wimbly).
    The program adds that new name to the names.txt file and then shows
    the menu again. In addition to adding new names, the user can also
    display the total number of names, and select a random name from
    the text file.
